# airPrep
A basic bash script that will verify you ran it with sudo before turning off NetworkManager, using RFkill, checking with airmon-ng then putting your wifi card into monitor mode. 
I strongly recommend you also be using a Kali Linu VM since it will already have root user.

Oh thing about that is the General Linux Process Org. is:

  1. User Process - GUI, Servers, Shell
  2. Kernel Process - System Calls, Process Management, Memory Management, Device Drivers
  3. Hardware - Processor (CPU), Process Management, Main Memory (RAM), Disks, Network Ports

Oh yeah forgot to add this on original upload...
